# gpt2-bot-handler-rust
A simple HTTP server using Rust and configuring it to manage HuggingFace text-to-text generator bot.

# Large response time
Due to less resources on hugging face it takes a while for the server to load the request.

# Resources
- HuggingFace for the ml models
- Rust based server to handle the requests

## Server live links

> **Note**
Though it is using gpt2-medium but it can use better models.
